We are immersed in and run our own entrepreneurial community: PARISOMA
For over a decade, weâ€™ve incubated 250 startups, invested in more than 20 businesses, and launched over a dozen ventures. 

Through PARISOMA, our coworking and event space in San Francisco, we work alongside startups and entrepreneurs. We witness the dynamism of creative thought and business innovation. We watch new endeavors succeed and fail, understand how methodologies rise and fall, and observe new technologies as they are adopted and abandoned.
