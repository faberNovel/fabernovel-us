##The talents weâ€™re looking for

Technophile, Curious, Precise and open-minded, you should have a solid tech, design and business culture, as well as a strong interest in the startup scene.

You should be collaborative and team-spirited, but self-driven, entrepreneurial, highly organized and rigorous. You are able to work autonomously and bring together a team around your project when needed.

You are curious about new technologies: you like getting into the code, and you want to understand how stuff works and create your own!
