The transportation industry is facing disruption in every part of the value chain. From manufacturing to consumer distribution, new technologies and players are transforming the way we think about and ‘consume’ mobility, creating new demands. 

FABERNOVEL believes the key to managing this disruption is setting and implementing a strategic roadmap in line with new innovations in transportation technology and changing consumer mindset about mobility.
