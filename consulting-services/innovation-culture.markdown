Industry landscapes are changing faster than ever. Competition can come from all angles. Attracting and keeping good talent is increasingly challenging. 

Swiftly adapting to these changes requires a culture of innovative thinking across the organization – from launching new ideas to adjusting processes to meet new business models. Strategy and business case are crucial, but execution will be dependent on all functions and departments to be in sync. 

**How can a corporation cultivate a culture for innovation to actively respond to changing landscapes?**

FABERNOVEL believes the answer lies in having the following four key elements working in conjunction: 

1. **Formally establish innovation as a strategic imperative of leadership** – enabling a structure and governance that supports innovation.

2. **Enable internal collaboration** – creating an open environment that can source ideas and best practices, instill transparency on goings-on, and coordinate cross-functional teams early and often.

3. **Leverage the external community** – going outside company walls to source new ideas and create ambassadors for your brand.

4. **Prototype new ideas to solve key business issues** – testing market viability is critical to launching any new idea; a safe platform for piloting will increase long-term ROI while allowing team members to be hands-on in the process.
