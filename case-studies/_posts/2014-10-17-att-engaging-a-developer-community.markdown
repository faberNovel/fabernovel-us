AT&T wanted to outsource innovation by leveraging the developer community.  However, getting developers to use their development tools was proving to be challenging. 

FABERNOVEL helped AT&T design new tools and messaging to engage developers around their resources. We organized a hackathon and brought in over 200 developers to use these new tools and develop applications.
