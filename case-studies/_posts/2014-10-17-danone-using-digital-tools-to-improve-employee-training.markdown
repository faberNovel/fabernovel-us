Danone launched a program to enable employees to learn from each other. To grow this program Danone wanted to leverage digital technologies to make the program more efficient. 

FABERNOVEL supported Danone in rethinking the role of digital in the Learning Program. 
Together we were able to identify new roles for their learning managers and conceptualize tools to support the digital change.
