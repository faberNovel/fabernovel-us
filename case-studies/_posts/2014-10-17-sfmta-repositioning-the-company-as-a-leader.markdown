SFMTA is one of the main providers of transportation services in the Bay Area. Despite this, travellers often rely on third party applications to navigate the city .

To increase the value of their transit services and become the go-to application, SFMTA and FABERNOVEL worked together to create an encompassing travel app. The new service provides transit information to travellers regardless of the time or device.
