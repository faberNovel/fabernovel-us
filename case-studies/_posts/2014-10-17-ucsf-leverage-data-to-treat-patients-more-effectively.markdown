Mutiple sclerosis (MS) is a difficult disease to diagnose and treat. UCSF was looking for a way to help doctors provide the best treatment to MS patients.

FABERNOVEL and UCSF identified key medical information from across the UCSF system. Based on this information, FABERNOVEL designed an application to display the patientâ€™s history,   compare treatment options., and easily track the progression of the disease over time.
