Avaya wanted to grow their Aura Platform by creating a new service for collaboration apps, to scale communications for customers with one million users on a single network. The new service had a different target audience and required a unique rollout plan. 

FABERNOVEL worked with Avaya in the launch of the new Aura Collaboration Environment. From defining the business model to identifying customer segments, FABERNOVEL created their Go-To-Market strategy and guided them through the growth of their new business segment.
