After three years of development, qbeats was ready to launch their product but was uncertain of how to break into the well-establish financial products market. 

FABERNOVEL worked with qbeats to create a Go-To-Market Strategy including: target segments, key messaging, marketing plan, and a development roadmap. 
 
FABERNOVEL coached qbeats through the acquisition of the first 1,000 users.
