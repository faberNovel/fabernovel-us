The last few days have been quite hectic at the New York Times. In the wake of Executive Editor Jill Abramson’s **dismissal**, the internal version of a report on innovation at the Times was **leaked***. The Nieman Journalism Lab has pored through the 97 pages of raw self-examination — « It’s journalists turning their own reporting skills on themselves ». Here are the few reactions these highlights have inspired me.

**That’s right, leaked to Buzzfeed, your favorite dealer of cats on skateboards and celebrity gossip.*

**YOU’LL NEVER ACHIEVE YOUR POTENTIAL AS A NEWSPAPER IF YOU DON’T VIEW YOURSELF AS A TECH COMPANY TOO**

- It’s good to produce **amazing interactive stories**, and **acclaimed portfolios**. It’s even better to be able to replicate these popular formats and re-use the developments. « I’d rather have a **_Snowfall_** builder than a *Snowfall* » says Quartz editor Kevin Delaney.

- A problem with tags is a problem with content promotion, SEO, and archive valorization. The NYT has a bunch of « timeless » content sitting in the dark.

- Digital teams at The New York Times (founded 1851) repeatedly compare with *Buzzfeed* — as do their counterparts at *BBC News*. And in fact, Buzzfeed does have something going with those **gif-based narrations of current political crises**.

 

**KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE: WHERE THEY COME FROM, WHERE THEY ARE GOING, WHAT THEY WANT, WHO THEY LIKE**

- Including your readers in your editorial project means asking your readers what they want; asking them if your reporters can contact them (why not start with star commenters?); asking them if they are willing to share personal info to receive tailored content in exchange. Newspapers have to stop fantasizing their reader and believing they know perfectly what those readers want.

- Great design doesn’t beat user trends: the Times’ cleverly old-fashioned homepage only attracts one third of the site’s traffic. Just like in any other online media, the article page draws the bulk of readers, and should be at the center of designers’ attention.

- It’s good to write awesome stories. It’s even better that they be shared: a paper’s stories are its main entrance, and investing in « discovery, promotion, and engagement » is everybody’s business.

- Great stories mean great reporters. And this means social sharing by reporters is more effective than by the newsroom.

 

**DELIVERING CONTENT IS A DYNAMIC PROCESS**

- « Content repackaging » is a thing, as proven by Reuters who « employs 2 people solely to search for underperforming stories to repackage and republish ».

- One thing digital media management can take from print media management: think « second hour stories », just like you would « second day stories », by planning hour-by-hour rollout of follow-up articles.

  

**TO INFINITY AND BEYOND CONTENT**

- Huge editorial credibility means huge potential for creating live events. On this side of the ocean, Le Monde has been quicker in following the New Yorker’s example with Le Monde Festival (of which FABERNOVEL is a proud partner).

*After the success of Snowfall, the interactive account of the 2012 avalanche in Tunnel Creek, the New York Times struck again and enhanced its coverage of the last Winter Olympics: scrollable interactive pages, self-launching full screen videos featuring additional footage from an American athlete’s point of view.

**BEING A TECH COMPANY MEANS WORKING LIKE A TECH COMPANY**

- The Times’ Reader Experience section is the team that deals with R&D, product, technology, analytics and design. A team of *625* people.

- Nevertheless, NYT staff feel their is quite a gap between the paper’s brand image (innovation-mindedness, as shown by the graphics and interactives the Times excels in) and the way things actually work at the paper (workflows, tools, strategy, skills).

- And indeed, coordinating news and business, as well as « embracing Reader Experience [Department] as an extension of the newsroom » are still on the NYT’s to-do list. Silo culture spares no one.

- Keeping up with reader expectations and technology standards is possible only if you have room to experiment. However, when launching a new project: set smart goals and metrics; accept the possibility it might fail; if it fails, stop it completely.

- At the Times and obviously throughout the industry, their is a real hiring / talent issue: people who work on digital matters leave because they see no progress and feel misunderstood and misused; and no top managers have solid competency to lead them.

 

**For the New York Times, challenges lie in organization, design, tech, and editing. But the issues raised by the « Gray Lady »’s Innovation report resonate broadly, and this thorough self-examination deserves the attention of any media organisation willing to survive in a digital world.**
