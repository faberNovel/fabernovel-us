**The transformation of business units: all managers and all coders?**

From an expert’s language to an accessible language for everyone, code is becoming a “super power”, able to unlock creativity, disrupt industries and transform our society.

A tool for innovation, prototyping and acceleration par excellence, code has become the secret weapon of the start-up model. As a new language, will code be the grammar 2.0 that all school children should know in order to develop their critical thinking skills in the digital age? As an economic paradigm, code will necessarily shape future firms by transforming them into real organizations of the 21st century : programmable organizations.
